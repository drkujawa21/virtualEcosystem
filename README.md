Day 1:
Created .h files for the species, movement, eating, and map. Established hierarchy.
Need to figure out how to read from .txt files and how to use them in the .h files.

Day 2:
Reduced amount of h files into 2. Created cpp files for all h files and created a main cpp file.
Working on how to parse the .txt files.
Need to finish parsing the .txt  files before anythign else.

Day 3:
Figured out how to read from file and put it into a map object. Created print functions for map.h. 
Need to next figure out how to move a species and create species from the species list in map. Might need to rearrange class hierarchy. !!!

Day 4:
Didnt get as much work done. 
Next goal is to figure out how to store each specimen and differentiate them from each other. A possible solution is to give each specimen a coordinate pair (ex. [row, col]).


Day 5:
Swapped to using unordered_map. Very helpful.
Trying to figure out how to store map.txt into an unordered_map.
Left off at main.cpp, continue work on Map.h. Pretty sure Species.h can wait for now.

Day 6:
Not much work. Day off lol. Need to figure out how to compare a char to other chars (if char is equal to " " or not).
